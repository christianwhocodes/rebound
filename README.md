# Rebound

Rebound is a simple paddle and ball game where the player must keep the ball from reaching the bottom of the playing area. The score is reflected at the bottom of the playing area. As the game progresses, difficulty is increased by moving the ball more quickly. Rebound includes some simple collision detection routines to reward the player for using the middle of the paddle. (game buzzes) It also includes some basic sound effects and a background music track. A settings panel lets players decide if they want to hear the sounds and start a new game. (game bloops)
